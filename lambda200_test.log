Testing JAMAdvanced with λ=200 (Robustness-Focused)
================================================================================

1. Performance Test (3 runs)...

================================================================================
GREEDY vs PURE INTRINSIC OPTIMIZATION COMPARISON
================================================================================
Runs: 3
Design steps: 40
Adaptation steps: 25

Final Comparison - 3 Agents:
  1. IndustryBest - Standard greedy performance maximization
  2. JAM - Logarithmic barrier with hard min (eliminates weight tuning)
  3. JAMAdvanced - Logarithmic barrier with softmin (smooth optimization)

✓ JAM/JAMAdvanced use PURE intrinsic optimization (NO external constraints)
✓ Automatic bottleneck focus via log(min/softmin) - no manual weight tuning
